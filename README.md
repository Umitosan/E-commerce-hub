## Description

This web-app is intended to be an E-Commerce template on which to build a professional store-front of your liking.

## User stories

* As a user, I want to add products to my cart while on the home page.
* As a user, I want to view a product's details while staying on the same page.
* As a user, I want the product's details to include at least a name, description, image, and price.
* As a user, while viewing my car, I want to remove items from the cart by clicking a button and I should see my cart total price update in real-time.

## Refactoring plan

* Generally: Use AJAX to keep the user experience  as seamless as possible
* Ensure that users can't order a negative number of items.
* Add flash messages for signing up, signing in and signing out.
* Add product validations.
* Add password validations to ensure a user's password is sufficiently complex.
* Add Stripe so users can pay when finalizing orders.
* Fix the row height for products, to prevent unevenness.
* Add Paperclip for product image upload.

* Add admin functionality (perhaps use Devise authentication instead)
* Allow other than whole dollar amounts for admin product creation (i.e. 3.99).
* Add product update and delete functionality for admins.
* Add admin flash messages for adding, updating and deleting products.
* Add admin links to navbar so admins can easily add, update and delete products.
* Add integration testing for AJAX functionality.
